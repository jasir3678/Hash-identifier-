# Hash Identifier Script

This Python script helps identify the type of a given hash value by comparing it against a predefined list of common cryptographic hash algorithms and formats. It uses regular expressions to match the input hash to known patterns associated with different hash types.

## Features
- Identifies common hash types such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and more.
- Supports hashing algorithms like SHA-224, SHA-3, RIPEMD-160, Bcrypt, Argon2, NTLM, and others.
- Uses regular expressions to match hash patterns to their corresponding types.
- Prints the hash value and possible matching types, or marks it as "Unknown" if no match is found.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run the script from the command line, passing a hash value as an argument:

```bash
python hash_identifier.py <hash_value>
